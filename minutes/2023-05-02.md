## Attendees

* Stephen Suffian (WattCarbon)

* André Bernal García

## Minutes

Updates on the API demonstrator :

* Topology:  Parent/child info is now available on each node
* Response format discussion: Do we want to have all the metadata in each element on the time series or as a separate element? Discussion leaned on having a single separated element to avoid redundancy

Updates on Engaging TSOs:

* Active conversations with Argentina and ENTSOE.
* Action items on following up with them and keep trying to engage.

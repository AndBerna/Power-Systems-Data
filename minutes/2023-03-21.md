# CDSC WG2 (Power Data) Meetings 2023-03-21

Sync meeting for the whole working group.

## Agenda

* Demonstration of updates to API demonstrator  - It is now live at [https://carbon-data-specification.onrender.com/docs](https://carbon-data-specification.onrender.com/docs)
* Demonstration of FAQ / Design doc for demonstrator

## Attendees

* Hallie Cramer (Google)
* Henry Richardson (WattTime)
* Katrina Stanford (Apple)
* Pierre Segonne (Electricity Maps) (Maintainer)
* Leon-Gerard Vandenberg (Sunified Group)

## Minutes

* Quick demo of the API demonstrator
* Hallie is supposed to fill a RFC for South-Carolina with Google. She wondered whether the demonstrator should be referenced.
* After the demo, it seems that it's not mature enough to share. The current version would be difficult for external people to understand and does not yet comply with the previous specs.
* Regarding sharing a design doc / FAQ for decisions underlying the demonstrator: It seems the demonstrator is not mature enough. This will be drafted after we've publicly demonstrated its working and gathered feedback.

## Actions items

* Contributors active on the demonstrator will regroup, make sure that the demonstrator matches the specifications drafted in the first two workstreams and organise a demo to the rest of the working group. Feedback will then be gathered and design document be drafted according to that feedback.

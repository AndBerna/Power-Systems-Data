## Agenda
- [Discussing whether to adopt the AIB for fuel types and technologies.](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Power-Systems-Data/issues/72)
- Continued Review of `metadata` section.

## Note
- We talked about the Pull Requests currently in the repo: [PR here](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Power-Systems-Data/pull/87)
- We agree on using the AIB code to define fuel technologies and fuel types until something better is proposed. 
- We fixed numbering conventions and reshuffled the order of the endpoints definitions to be consistent
- We added description fields (in some cases just placeholders) and Request object definitions to all the endpoints.
- We define "metadata" as non-timeseries data, data that doesn't frequently change or have values associated with it.
- We standardized language around "topology levels" (in some cases it was called the type instead).


## Action Items
- Set up a Co-Working session to continue standardizing the document (Steve and Henry)
- Align Power-Systems-Data-Demonstrator with the current spec (Steve and André)

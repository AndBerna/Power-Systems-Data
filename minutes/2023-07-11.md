Attendees
-------------
- Stephen Suffian (WattCarbon) (Maintainer)
- André Bernal Garcia (External Collaborator)
- Hallie Cramer (Google)
- Henry Richardson (WattTime)

Agenda
-------------
Discuss Spec 3 pre-draft.
- What parameters/suggestions do we want to provide regarding PSR `id` formulation?
- How to deal with nested pagination (i.e. in the children list in the  `/topology` endpoint)?
- Should we return to allowing for generation endpoints to have `id` in the request? If so, how?
- Should we go with AIB codes for our fuel types?
- Transmission - Should it be in a separate spec? 


Notes
-------------
### Updates
André - Updated GridNode to PowerSystemResource in the demonstrator

### Spec 3 Pre-Draft
- Need to decide between resource/class for parent endpoint term
- Which fuel type/technology set to use?
  -	Hallie - Reference a few different examples in addition to AIB.
  -	Henry - Preference to picking a single "fuel type/technology" set so that there is consistency across.
  -	Hallie - Acknowledge other ways, and provide reasoning for selecting X
-	Henry - LEED has the official requirements and then a separate spec document.
-	Henry - We need the concept of "siblings" as well as transmission.
-	Henry - What is the best way to nest datetime vs technology/fuel type information?
-	André - Why have a separate topology and describe endpoint? Too many endpoints makes it difficult to know what to do.
-	Henry - How do we specify how large amounts of data are received? 
	 - Pagination?
	 - Data limitations? - Standards shouldn't set a strict limit because technology might change and server size.
	 - Other?


To-Dos
-------------
- Naming for the prefix in the metadata API endpoints
- Add missing fuel-type example
- Fix issues between text descriptions and endpoint examples
- Add siblings to incorporate interconnection definitions
- Fuel Sources/Technologies - Reference different options, possibly pick one and explain reasoning
- Split out document into formal spec and "overview"
- Discuss timeseries nesting of datetimes vs nesting of fuel types/technologies
- Add capacity endpoints
- Add other endpoints

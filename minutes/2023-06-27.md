Attendees
-------------
- Stephen Suffian (WattCarbon) (Maintainer)
- André Bernal Garcia (External Collaborator)
- Tom (TransitionZero)
- Shankho (Advanced Infrastructure)

Agenda
---------
* Check up on TODOs
   * Fuel Types vs Technology Discussion
   * Transmission Nodes
* Discuss next steps
   * Add optional metadata field to PowerSystemResource objects
   * Begin write-up of demonstrator into spec language
   * Re-organize specs into a more functional form

Notes
--------
* Summary Talk
* Tom
  * IEA has some hierarchy of fuels
  * Sub-critical vs Supercritical coal power plants are also important for carbon intensity calculations
  * Have already done related work and it is open source
  * Currently doing ML work for grid detection of non US/Europe grid topology data
* Shankho
  * UN has a macroeconomic-scale model based on technologies
    * Fuel type topology is available as well
* Goal for next working group meeting is to get more work going towards the endpoints
* André
  * A flat structure of fuel types and technologies might be easier and then include optional fields might be helpful. The more we nest, the more data is obscured.

TODOs
----------
* Pull together information from UN/IAMC work to think about what fields would be most important (Shankho)
* Pull links together for fuel type information and existing work done in this space (Tom)
* Connect TransitionZero to the Steering Committee to discuss more expansive collaboration (Steve)

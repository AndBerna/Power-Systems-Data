## Introduction <a id="introduction" href="#introduction" class="permalink">üîó</a>
This specification was developed as part of the global effort to combat the climate crisis. Specifically, in order to scalably measure carbon emissions of organizations and calculate the impact of deploying and operating clean energy technologies, companies need an efficient means to discover the details and capabilities of energy utilities and other similar entities.

This specification offers a topological graph model of electricity grids that has been defined by this working group, which is to be used for subsequent specifications. This specification is intended to be a starting point for defining the necessary terms of structure for developing a data streaming specification.

## 2. Terms and definitions <a id="terms-and-definitions" href="#terms-and-definitions" class="permalink">üîó</a>

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply.

ISO and IEC maintain terminological databases for use in standardization at the following addresses:

- 	ISO Online browsing platform: available at https://www.iso.org/obp
- 	IEC Electropedia: available at http://www.electropedia.org/

This specification was informed through conversations with multiple Transmission System Operators as well as consulting IEC 62325-351. The following terms will be specifically used:

- <b>PowerSystemResource</b>: A power system resource (PSR) can be an item of equipment such as a switch, an equipment container containing many individual items of equipment such as a substation, or an organisational entity such as sub-control area. Power system resources can have measurements associated.

### 3. Topology<a id="topology" href="#topology" class="permalink">üîó</a>

### Topology Relationship
We envision that any electric power grid can be described as a directed graph where nodes are different components of the power system elements and edges are connections between them.

        end
    end
    nodeetc[...]
    node3dynamic-->node1dynamic
    node2dynamic-->node1dynamic
    node1dynamic-->nodeetc
```
To describe a power system topology we therefore need to enumerate the possible nodes, and edges, as well as their definitions.

### Granularity Levels

We might not want to strictly define specific named levels in the hierarchy, since each grid might be structured slightly differently. There can be a different number of levels for each region, but we should make sure that equivalent structures in each region use the same level numbers (this may mean that in some regions, certain levels are skipped).

|Level|US Grid|European Grid|CIM|Definition|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|0|Interconnect|Synchronous area|GeographicalRegion |
|1|Balancing Area|LFC block/LFC area|| |
|2|Trading Hub / Transmission-congested zone|Bidding zone|SubGeographicalRegion | |
|3|Transmission Node/Substation|Control area|Substation | |
|4|Distribution Node/Substation or Power Plant|Scheduling Area/Sub scheduling area|Feeder| |
|5|Meter (Generator or Load)|Metering Grid Area|ACDCTerminal | |

### Graph Edges
|Level or Inter-level|Description|Type|Data|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|0|Between Interconnects|Physical: DC transmission lines|Line capacity, etc| |
|0-1|Balancing Area to Interconnect Mapping|Virtual|Mapping table| |
|1|Between Balancing Areas|Physical: Transmission lines | | |
|1-2|Hubs to BAs|Virtual|Mapping table| |
|2|Between Trading Hubs / Transmission-congested zones|Physical: Transmission lines | | |
|2-3|Transmission Substation to Hub|Virtual|Mapping table| |
|3|Between Transmission Nodes/Substation|Physical: Transmission lines | | |
|3-4|Distribution Substations/Plants to Transmission Nodes|Physical: subtransmission lines||Line |
|4|Between Distribution Node/Substation or Power Plant|N/A? | | |
|4-5|Meters to substations/plants|Physical: distribution lines|| |
|5|Between Meters (Generator or Load)|N/A?| | |

### 4. Entities<a id="entities" href="#tentities" class="permalink">üîó</a>

We propose to define data types for three different kinds of entities. These entities would all be defined as nodes in the [topology graph](#terms-and-definitions--topology). The three kinds of entities are:

* System. A system is the lowest granularity level in the topology graph. It is a collection of other entities. A system can for example be a single synchronous grid, or a collection of synchronous grids.
* Market. A market is a collection of nodes that are connected to each other through a single market operator. A market can for example be a single balancing area, or a collection of balancing areas.
* Unit. A unit is a single physical entity. A unit can for example be a single power plant, or a single generation unit within that plant.

### Other Entities 

Some data types are defined for multiple variables. For example, emissions can be reported for multiple pollutants, or production can be reported for multiple fuel types.

In these cases, the data type is defined once, and we specify henceforth that the data type is a variable. The variables are defined as follows:


| Fuel type                   |
|-----------------------------|
| Brown coal/Lignite          |
| Hard coal                   |

## 2. Introduction <a id="introduction" href="#introduction" class="permalink">üîó</a>
This specification was developed as part of the global effort to combat the climate crisis. Specifically, in order to scalably measure carbon emissions of organizations and calculate the impact of deploying and operating clean energy technologies, companies need an efficient means to discover the details and capabilities of energy utilities and other similar entities.

This specification offers a specification for a set of endpoints that would contain the necessary information for carbon data calculations.

### 3.2 PowerSystemsResources Metadata<a id="endpoints-psrmeta" href="#endpoints-psrmeta" class="permalink">üîó</a>

The primary set of endpoints reference PowerSystemResource (PSR) objects. These objects contain several metadata fields as well as timeseries information such as generation, demand, and capacity.

##### Request Object
- `type`: _string_ - (OPTIONAL) - An optional filter to only return PSR objects with the given *type*.

##### Response Object
- `id` - _string_ - (REQUIRED) - The unique identifier representing this resource. It SHOULD be human-readable, and where appropriate, MAY incorporate the `id` of its parent objects in order to easily understand its place in the topology. An example of such an id is `US-WECC-CISO`. The `id` MUST be URL safe. 
- `type` - _string_ - (REQUIRED) - The id of the resource type for this PowerSystemsResource.
-  `name` - _string_ - (OPTIONAL) - A descriptive name to provide additional context to the PSR.

***TODO: Placeholder spot for where we can decide what rules/guidelines/parameters/suggestions would be good for generating human-readable PSR `id`s*** [Github Issue](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Power-Systems-Data/issues/80)

#### Example
The following is an example of the endpoint that returns a list of power system resources. This LIST endpoint SHOULD only includes the `id`, `name`, and `type` fields. It MUST not contain fields of undefined size (such as fields that con contain lists or dicts), as this endpoint is meant to be capable of returning several entries.

#### 3.3.4 PSR Exports `/power-system-resources/{id}/exports`
An export object returns a timeseries of values representing energy that was exported to a PSR. 

##### Request Object
- `startDatetime` - _ISO8601 Datetime_ -  A datetime indicating that the response should return data where the earliest entry's *startDatetime* occurs AT or AFTER the *startDatetime* specified in the request.  
- `endDatetime` - _ISO8601 Datetime_ -  A datetime indicating that the response should return data where the earliest entry's *endDatetime* occurs AT or BEFORE the *endDatetime* specified in the request.  

##### Response Object
-  `id` - _string_ - (REQUIRED) - The `id` of the Power System Resource associated with this export.
- 	`unit` - _string_ - (REQUIRED) - For electricity, SHOULD be one of:  [`MWh`, `kWh`, `Wh`]
- `exports` - _Array_
	-  `startDatetime` - _ISO8601 Datetime_ - (REQUIRED) - The datetime MUST be timezone aware.
	-   `endDatetime` - _ISO8601 Datetime_ - (REQUIRED)  - The datetime MUST be timezone aware.
	- `value` - _positive float_ - (REQUIRED) - A value of the amount of energy exported by this PSR. The value must be 0 or a positive value (imports should be provided in the other endpoint).
	  - `valueByConnectedPSR` - _Array_ - (REQUIRED) - Key-value pairs of the connected PSR that this PSR is exporting energy to and the amount of energy that comes from that PSR. The unit for these values MUST be the same as that of the `unit` field.
	  - `connectedPSR` - _String_
	  - `value` - _positive float_ - A value of the amount of energy exported to the `connectedPSR`. The value must be 0 or a positive value (exports should be provided in the other endpoint).

#### 3.3.5 PSR Prices `/power-system-resources/{id}/price`
A demand object returns a timeseries of values representing energy that was demanded at a PSR.

##### Request Object
- `startDatetime` - _ISO8601 Datetime_ -  A datetime indicating that the response should return data where the earliest entry's *startDatetime* occurs AT or AFTER the *startDatetime* specified in the request.  
- `endDatetime` - _ISO8601 Datetime_ -  A datetime indicating that the response should return data where the earliest entry's *endDatetime* occurs AT or BEFORE the *endDatetime* specified in the request.  
- `timeframe` - _Enum_ - One of `day-ahead`, `hour-ahead`, `real-time`

##### Response Object
-  `id` - _string_ - (REQUIRED) - The `id` of the Power System Resource associated with this demand.
- 	`unit` - _string_ - (REQUIRED) - Should be a a currency code in accordance with the [ISO 4217](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html) standard. 
- `timeframe` - _String_ The selected `timeframe` from the request object
- `demand` - _Array_

#### 3.3.6 PSR Curtailment `/power-system-resources/{id}/curtailment`
A curtailment object returns a timeseries of values representing energy that was generated at a PSR, as well as a breakdown of that generation by fuel type.

##### Request Object
- `startDatetime` - _ISO8601 Datetime_ -  A datetime indicating that the response should return data where the earliest entry's *startDatetime* occurs AT or AFTER the *startDatetime* specified in the request.  
- `endDatetime` - _ISO8601 Datetime_ -  A datetime indicating that the response should return data where the earliest entry's *endDatetime* occurs AT or BEFORE the *endDatetime* specified in the request.

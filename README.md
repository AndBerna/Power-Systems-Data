# Power Systems Data Working Group

This repository is dedicated to the [Power Systems Data Working Group](https://powersystemsdata.carbondataspec.org/).

## Goal

> The Power Systems Data Working Group aims to define an open specification for raw electric power system data to facilitate a systematic and more accurate approach to report grid emissions.

The full scope is described in the [Scope](2_Scope.md) section.

## Get Started

ðŸ‘‹ We are always open to welcoming new contributors! ðŸ‘‹

You can get involved in a number of ways. We gather contributors that bring technical expertise, contributors that are consumers of power systems data, as well as contributors that want to push for open data in the power sector.

A good place to start is to look at our website: [https://powersystemsdata.carbondataspec.org/](https://powersystemsdata.carbondataspec.org/).
